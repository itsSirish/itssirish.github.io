**Hiya, I'm Sirish Visweswar**, a graduate student pursuing Computer Science at NYU. I'm currently working as a Computational Neuroscience Researcher at the Neuroinformatics Lab under Prof. Erdem Varol, where my research focuses on **cross-modal neural foundational models and multimodal translation architectures** that bridge the gap between different sensory modalities and data representations.

I'm naturally curious and constantly seeking opportunities to grow—whether through cutting-edge research, innovative side projects, or creative endeavors that push the boundaries of what's possible.

My primary research interests lie at the **intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and neuroscience**, exploring how artificial neural networks can better understand and emulate biological intelligence. Beyond my core focus, I've explored reinforcement learning for strategic game environments, natural language processing for human-AI interaction, and game development as a creative outlet.

Outside the world of technology, I find inspiration in creating art as a hobby—a practice that profoundly influences how I approach complex problems with a unique blend of **creativity, structure, and innovative thinking**.
