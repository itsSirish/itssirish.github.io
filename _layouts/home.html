    <p>
      <strong>Hiya, I'm Sirish Visweswar</strong>, a graduate student pursuing
      Computer Science at NYU. I'm currently working as a Computational
      Neuroscience Researcher at the Neuroinformatics Lab under Prof. Erdem
      Varol, where my research focuses on
      <strong
        >cross-modal neural foundational models and multimodal translation
        architectures</strong
      >
      that bridge the gap between different sensory modalities and data
      representations.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      I'm naturally curious and constantly seeking opportunities to grow—whether
      through cutting-edge research, innovative side projects, or creative
      endeavors that push the boundaries of what's possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      My primary research interests lie at the
      <strong
        >intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and
        neuroscience</strong
      >, exploring how artificial neural networks can better understand and
      emulate biological intelligence. Beyond my core focus, I've explored
      reinforcement learning for strategic game environments, natural language
      processing for human-AI interaction, and game development as a creative
      outlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the world of technology, I find inspiration in creating art as a
      hobby—a practice that profoundly influences how I approach complex
      problems with a unique blend of
      <strong>creativity, structure, and innovative thinking</strong>.
