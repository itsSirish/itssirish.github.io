    <p>
      <strong>Hiya, I'm Sirish Visweswar</strong> ðŸ‘‹, a graduate student in
      Computer Science at NYU. Iâ€™m currently a Computational Neuroscience
      Researcher at the Neuroinformatics Lab with Prof. Erdem Varol, where I
      explore
      <strong
        >cross-modal foundation models and multimodal translation
        architectures</strong
      >
      that connect EEG and fMRI data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iâ€™ve always been curious by nature and love diving into new areasâ€”whether
      through research, side projects, or creative hobbies. My primary interests
      sit at the
      <strong
        >intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and
        neuroscience</strong
      >, but Iâ€™ve also dabbled in
      <strong
        >reinforcement learning, game development, blockchain, and NLP</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before NYU, I completed my undergrad thesis at
      <strong>Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</strong>, working on
      <strong
        >text augmentation and LLM-based paraphrasing for Named Entity
        Recognition</strong
      >. I also published a paper in
      <strong
        ><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10301669"
          >IEEE Sensors Letters</a
        ></strong
      >
      on deep learning for ECG-based myocardial infarction detection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of tech, Iâ€™m into creating <strong>art</strong>, which keeps me
      grounded and feeds into my problem-solving styleâ€”a mix of
      <strong>creativity, structure, and curiosity</strong>.
